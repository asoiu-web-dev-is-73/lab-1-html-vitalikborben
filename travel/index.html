     </h2>
      <h3>		<p> <span>Kiev </span>  is the capital and largest city of Ukraine, located in the north central part of the country on the 			Dnieper. The population in July 2015 was 2,887,974 (though higher estimated numbers have been cited in the press), making 				Kiev the 7th most populous city in Europe.  <p>
     			<p> <span>T</span>he city's name is said to derive from the name of Kyi, one of its four legendary founders .During its history, Kiev, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, passed through several stages of great prominence and relative obscurity. The city probably existed as a commercial centre as early as the 5th century. A Slavic settlement on the great trade route between Scandinavia and Constantinople, Kiev was a tributary of the Khazars  until seized by the Varangians (Vikings) in the mid-9th century. Under Varangian rule, the city became a capital of the Kievan Rus', the first East Slavic state. Completely destroyed during the Mongol invasion in 1240, the city lost most of its influence for the centuries to come. It was a provincial capital of marginal importance in the outskirts of the territories controlled by its powerful neighbours;  first the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, followed by Poland and Russia. </p>
